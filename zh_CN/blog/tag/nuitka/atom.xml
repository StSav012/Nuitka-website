    <title>First Nuitka Live Stream</title>

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, Saturday 15.01.2022, there will be not one, but two live
stream of me coding on Nuitka, and talking and chatting with visitors in
the Discord channel created specifically for this. I will go from 9-12
CEST and from 17-20 CEST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="/pages/Streaming.html"&gt;dedicated page on the web site&lt;/a&gt;
which has the details. Spoiler, it’s free and I have no plans for
anything that involves a subscription of any kind. Of course, talking of
subscription, do also checkout the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/doc/commercial.html"&gt;Nuitka commercial&lt;/a&gt; offering. That is a subscription with adds that
protect your IP even more than regular Nuitka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to do this on a regular basis, and I will be happy to do this
even when nearly nobody shows up. It will be however your chance, and in
previous GSoC and generally, I made very good experiences with joint
sessions. So I hope you will help me pasting code snippets and Google
results in chat, and discuss the optimization that we are going to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and join me there. &lt;a class="reference external" href="/pages/Streaming.html"&gt;Instructions&lt;/a&gt; here.
You know you want to do it. I know I want you to do to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Yours,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Kay&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Next Nuitka Live Stream</title>
    <updated>2022-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="next-nuitka-live-stream"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Sunday 30.01.2022, there will be the third live stream of me
coding on Nuitka, and talking and chatting with visitors in the Discord
channel created specifically for this. I will go from 9-12 CEST and from
18 CEST until probably at least 20 CEST, but it seems I tend to go
overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="last-time"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Last time&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the last two streams are on my Youtube, these are around 4h videos,
done on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second stream I was working on Onefile compression for all Python
versions, by making the location of another Python that for Scons we
sort of did already, reusable. So now, you can run Nuitka with Python2.6
and compile your legacy code, while with say 3.6 also installed on the
same system, you do the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;zstandard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; compression. That will be used for
other things in the future as well. This is going to be part of the next
release and currently on develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first stream, I also did a little bit of performance plans, but
mostly only showing people what I have there in stock, not actually went
there and I started work on a &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;upx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; plugin, such that DLLs for
standalone are compressed with that. That also required a bit of plugin
interface changes and research. This one works mostly, but will need
more live. Also I think I looked at reducing what is included with the
follow standard library option, getting very minimal distributions out
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="this-time"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This time&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around, this last stream, was a huge success. I was a bit under the
weather last weekend, but we go on now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure yet, what to do. I might be debugging issues I have with 2.6
and a recent optimization, that prevents factory branch from becoming
the next pre-release, I might be looking at macOS still. And I might be
looking at the caching of bytecode demoted modules, that is kind of
ready to be used, but is not currently, which is a pity. And of course,
the Python PGO may get a closer look, such that e.g. it works for
standalone mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="how-to-join"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to Join&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="/pages/Streaming.html"&gt;dedicated page on the web site&lt;/a&gt;
which has the details. Spoiler, it’s free and I have no plans for
anything that involves a subscription of any kind. Of course, talking of
subscription, do also checkout the &lt;a class="reference external" href="/doc/commercial.html"&gt;Nuitka commercial&lt;/a&gt; offering. That is a subscription with adds that
protect your IP even more than regular Nuitka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="join-me"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Join me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come and join me there. &lt;a class="reference external" href="/pages/Streaming.html"&gt;Instructions&lt;/a&gt; here.
You know you want to do it. I know I want you to do to it!&lt;/p&gt;
